# Game Theoretical Model for MEV-Boost Auction Bidding
Thanks to Stefanos, Carmine, and Thomas for helpful advice.

This repository contains some codes for simulations of the game theoretical model for MEV-Boost auction.

The simulation is implemented using Mesa, an agent-based modelling tool of Python.

For the detailed design of the model, refer to https://hackmd.io/@soispoke/Sy-B_gaU2.
